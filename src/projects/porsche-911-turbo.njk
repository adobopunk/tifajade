      Porsche and Rocket League teamed up to bring the Porsche 911 to the game,
      and kicked it all off with a $50,000 tournament. Although time constraints
      didn't allow an animated trailer to be completed in time for the event,
      this unfinished concept showcases the direction I envisioned.

<h2>Design</h2>
<div class="side-by-side">
  <p class="big">
    Vibrant colors accent a glitchy cyberpunk motion texture for a visual feast
    of a broadcast.
  </p>
  <p>
    Taking direction from the Rocket League art team’s seasonal branding, I
    crafted a looping visual glitch to serve as the background visual for this
    high energy tournament design. To create cohesion, this visual texture was
    used across various broadcast screens and event social media alike.

<h2>Animation</h2>
<div class="side-by-side">
  <p class="big">
    A high-concept 3D announcement trailer to kick off a high-octane event.
  </p>
  <p>
    With just a few weeks to put together an announcement trailer, I crafted a
    3D animation concept that featured the Porsche 911 Turbos kicking off a 2v2
    match as the ball drops into the arena, while highlighting the iconic
    Porsche emblem on the cars. Although time constraints ultimately wouldn't
    allow for the completion of this animation in time for the event, this
    unfinished concept represents my original vision for the video.

<h2>Broadcast Design</h2>
<div class="side-by-side">
  <p class="big">
    Extending the high-energy style into every corner of the broadcast was our
    goal, ensuring the visual experience carried seamlessly from social media to
    the live event.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each screen was carefully crafted to maintain the sleek yet edgy vibe that
    fit both Porsche’s brand and Rocket League’s audience. A custom overlay,
    integrated with the Rocket League API, allowed for real-time updates and
    live stats, blending dynamic visuals with crucial game information to keep
    fans fully engaged in the action.
