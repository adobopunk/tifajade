      Porsche and Rocket League teamed up to bring the Porsche 911 to the game,
      and kicked it all off with a $50,000 tournament. Although time constraints
      didn't allow an animated trailer to be completed in time for the event,
      this unfinished concept showcases the direction I envisioned.

    Taking direction from the Rocket League art team’s seasonal branding, I
    crafted a looping visual glitch to serve as the background visual for this
    high energy tournament design. To create cohesion, this visual texture was
    used across various broadcast screens and event social media alike.
