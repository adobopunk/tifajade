      Porsche and Rocket League teamed up to bring the Porsche 911 to the game,
      and kicked it all off with a $50,000 tournament. Taking direction from the
      Rocket League art teamâ€™s seasonal branding, I helped crafted a high-energy
      tournament design. Although time constraints didn't allow an animated
      trailer to be completed in time for the event, this unfinished concept
      showcases the direction I envisioned.
