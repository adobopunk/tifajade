      The Fortnite team aimed to spotlight their Fortnite OG event with
      "Reunion," a tournament that reunited past and present legends on the OG
      map. Working closely with the team at Epic to learn exactly which
      locations would return, I rendered nostalgic map features as charming cake
      toppers, presenting the returning map as a stylized, class-reunion style
      cake for an unforgettable event trailer.

<h2>Broadcast Design</h2>

<div class="side-by-side">
  <p class="big">An oh-so-sweet motion system for a fun, dynamic broadcast.</p>
  <p>
    With the cake as a centerpiece, I animated Mateo's logo into a 3D stinger,
    capturing the playful essence of the event. We designed custom broadcast
    screens and elements that harmonized with the cake's aesthetic, integrating
    bold colors and lively graphics that realized a cohesive and immersive
    broadcast design.
