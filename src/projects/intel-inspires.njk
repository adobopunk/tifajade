      For Intel, I created an engaging motion graphics package for their high
      school and college esports summit "Intel Inspires." Featuring live LAN
      competitions, the three day event was attended by over 1,000 students.
      Designer Mateo Julia-Wise and I were on-site to program the graphics at
      Esports Stadium Arlington, where I also captured roaming footage of
      everything from intense gameplay moments to behind-the-scenes
      interactions. The footage complemented our motion graphics, allowing me to
      connect Intel's brand with its audience through dynamic design and
      authentic moments.
