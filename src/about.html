          <b>If you're reading us, consider us friends! </b>I’m an animator
          passionate about telling stories through motion, blending artistic
          vision with purposeful design to create meaningful experiences.

          >. Currently, I'm a freelance motion designer and the Animation
          Director at BoomTV. I have a multidisciplinary background that blends
          my experience with video production, motion design, programming, and
          3D animation. My work is driven by a passion to help improve everyday
          lives, always striving to connect with and inspire the communities I
          engage with.

          bring all these elements together than through a career in animation?
          In my free time you can developing film,
