      <p>My friends call me TJ.</p>

    <p>
      And if you're reading us, consider us friends! I’m a freelance 3D motion
      designer and Animation Director at BoomTV, blending my love for motion
      design, visual effects, and storytelling into every project. My journey
      has been far from traditional—I'm a self-taught VFX artist who spent spent
      four years as a video editor for
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship"
        >UFC</a
      >. These days I spend a lot of time doing R&D, exploring the intersection
      of motion design and 3D art.

      I'm always looking for ways to improve my capabilities. In fact, I learned
      how to code just so I could make this portfolio, and I'm constantly
      developing it. Hopefully you'll revisit it from time to time and see what
      new features I've added! I’m always working on new ways to push my design
      skills forward. I have a background in music production and love crafting
      audioreactive visuals.

      My passion for animation and motion design comes from the way different
      disciplines coalesce into something whole. I studied film in college, and
      my background as a filmmaker helped me realize I was interested in every
      aspect of the process - art direction, cinematography, sound design, music
      composition, etc. Eventually I realized: what better way to make use of
      all these elements, than through a career in animation? Thanks for
      checking out my portfolio, and I hope you enjoyed your time here!
