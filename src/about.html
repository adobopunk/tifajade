          <b>If you're reading this, consider us friends! </b>I have a talent
          for telling stories through motion. I come from a very
          multidisciplinary background - I was the film student who fell in love
          with every aspect of the creative process! I carried my passion for so
          many different creative outlets forward into a career in motion
          design, and I've never stopped learning new technologies and tools as
          I continuously improve my craft.
