				<p>My friends call me TJ.</p>
			</h1>
			<p>
				And if you're reading us, consider us friends! I’m a
				freelance 3D motion designer and Animation Director at
				BoomTV, blending my love for motion design, visual effects,
				and storytelling into every project. My journey has been far
				from traditional—I'm a self-taught VFX artist who spent
				spent four years as a video editor for
				<a
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship"
					>UFC</a
				>. These days I spend a lot of time doing R&D, exploring the
				intersection of motion design and 3D art.
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm always looking for ways to improve my capabilities. In
				fact, I learned how to code just so I could make this
				portfolio, and I'm constantly developing it. Hopefully
				you'll revisit it from time to time and see what new
				features I've added! I’m always working on new ways to push
				my design skills forward. I have a background in music
				production and love crafting audioreactive visuals.
			</p>
			<p>
				My passion for animation and motion design comes from the
				way different disciplines coalesce into something whole. I
				studied film in college, and my background as a filmmaker
				helped me realize I was interested in every aspect of the
				process - art direction, cinematography, sound design, music
				composition, etc. Eventually I realized: what better way to
				make use of all these elements, than through a career in
				animation? Thanks for checking out my portfolio, and I hope
				you enjoyed your time here!
