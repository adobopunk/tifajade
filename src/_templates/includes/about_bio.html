      I fell in love with the creative process as a filmmaker, inspiring teams
      to come together to create work that pushes boundaries and connects on a
      deeply personal level. Now I work with global brands as an animation
      director and creative producer, directing marketing campaigns at the
      highest level for companies like Xbox, Fortnite, and Mountain Dew.

      While I’ve worked with some of the biggest names in sports and
      entertainment, at the end of the day, it’s all about the craft. I love
      bringing ambitious ideas to life, developing workflows that solve
      problems, and pushing the limits of what's possible.
