      I’m a Creative Director and Animator with over thirteen years of
      experience leading high-impact creative campaigns in esports, gaming, and
      entertainment. I specialize in blending bold visual storytelling with
      strategic project leadership, driving audience engagement and revenue
      growth across multi-platform content.

    <p class="med">
      With a background that spans motion design, 2D/3D animation, and video
      production, I thrive at bringing creative teams together to execute
      ambitious ideas at the highest level. Whether directing large-scale brand
      campaigns, developing streamlined content pipelines, or crafting cinematic
      storytelling for global audiences, my sweet spot is the intersection of
      creativity and strategy.
