        <h2>Let's Connect!</h2>
        <p>If youâ€™re interested in collaborating, please fill out this quick form to help me get the big picture of your project. Don't skimp on details - the more specific you can be, the better!

          </p>

           <p> I prioritize projects that feel like a great fit, but as long as you have a serious inquiry I <b>will</b> get back to you. I'm especially enthusiastic about collaborating on projects that prioritize social impact and humanitarian efforts. If your work aims to promote equality and tackle social issues, I would love to connect and explore how we can work together. </p>
           <p> I enjoy having my creative capabilities challenged. If you don't see an exact example of what you're looking for within my portfolio, don't let that dissuade you. Research and development are my forte, and I have a knack for finding creative solutions to problems. If you'd like to just send me a friendly message, email me at <a href="mailto:hi@tifajade.com">hi@tifajade.com</a>.</p>
