        <p>If youâ€™re interested in collaborating, please fill out this quick form to help me get the big picture of your project. Don't skimp on details - the more specific you can be, the better!

          </p>

           <p> My goal is to respond to every inquiry, and I prioritize projects that feel like a great fit. I'm a one-woman creative studio and I enjoy being challenged. If you don't see an exact example of what you're looking for within my portfolio, don't let that dissuade you. Research and development are my forte, and I have a knack for finding solutions to problems.</p>
           <p> I'm especially passionate about projects that focus on social impact and humanitarian missions. If you're working to help create equality and address social challenges, I would love to hear from you. If you'd like to just send me a quick message, email me at <a href="mailto:hi@tifajade.com">hi@tifajade.com</a>.</p>
