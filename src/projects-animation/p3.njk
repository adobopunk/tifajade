      Highlighting a brand through authentic, personal storytelling.
    </p>
    <p>
      For P3, I had the opportunity to work on a series of documentary style
      videos featuring select UFC fighters. Working with UFC Champion Aljamain
      Sterling, Donald Cerrone, and Maurice Greene, I collaborated with UFC's
      production team to tell unique stories about the lives of each fighter,
      incorporating how they use P3 portable protein snacks to stay fueled
      throughout the day.

  <h2>The Challenge</h2>
  <div class="side-by-side">
    <p>
      1. P3 wanted to go beyond standard sponsorship—this wasn’t just about logo
      placements or product shots. The challenge was to authentically integrate
      P3 into real UFC fighter routines, making it feel like a natural part of
      their training lifestyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The features needed to highlight the fighters first, the brand
      second—ensuring that P3’s message was woven into the storytelling, rather
      than feeling like a traditional ad.

  <h2>The Solution</h2>
  <p class="big">A Documentary Approach to Brand Storytelling</p>
  <p>
    Each feature was shot and edited in a cinematic, behind-the-scenes style,
    giving fans an intimate look at the fighters’ daily lives. With my
    experience in documentary storytelling, it felt like a natural fit to
    gravitate towards this style of storytelling, using training footage,
    personal interviews, and high-energy fight prep sequences to make the
    content feel raw and real.
  </p>
  <p>
    Instead of forced product placement, P3 was naturally embedded into the
    fighters’ nutrition routines, gym sessions, and on-the-go
    moments—reinforcing its role as a performance-focused brand.
