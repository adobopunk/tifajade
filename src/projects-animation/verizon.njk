<h2>The Challenge</h2>

<div class="side-by-side">
  <p class="big">
    {{ subtitle }}
  </p>
  <p>
    In collaboration with Xbox Game Pass and Verizon, I helped bring massive Sea
    of Thieves and Minecraft events to life through a series of high-profile
    gaming events, cinematic trailers, and custom tournament branding, all
    designed to inform and attract fans to Verizon's All-Access Campaign with
    Xbox. These promotional events combined engaging storytelling, immersive
    in-game visuals, and creator-led broadcasts to make All-Access a visible
    force in the gaming space. I had to keep in mind:
  </p>
</div>

<div class="side-by-side">
  <p>
    1. Unlike traditional esports titles, Sea of Thieves and Minecraft don’t
    have built-in competitive formats. Each event needed to be custom-designed
    to create thrilling gameplay moments while keeping Verizon’s brand
    integration organic and immersive.
  </p>
  <p>
    2. The success of these campaigns would depend on drawing high-profile
    gaming creators to drive engagement, meaning the content strategy needed to
    capture attention before, during, and after the events.
  </p>
  <p>
    3. From Verizon-branded hub worlds in Minecraft to dynamic tournament
    branding in Sea of Thieves, the challenge was ensuring the branding felt
    natural while reinforcing Xbox’s All Access messaging.

  <div>
    <p>
      For Skyblock Showdown, we transformed Minecraft’s classic Skyblock
      challenge into a fully branded, Verizon-powered challenge. With
      custom-curated gameplay and 37 unique challenges, the event pushed
      creators to strategize, collaborate, and compete for victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      To ensure seamless Verizon integration, I teamed up with Starfish Studios
      to design a Verizon-branded hub world. With top creators like DrLupo,
      SmallAnt, and Hannahxxrose, the event hit 26,000+ peak concurrent viewers,
      making it one of the biggest Verizon x Xbox activations to date.

      <p>
        Sea of Thieves has always been about freedom and exploration, but for
        Bilge Rat Bingo, we introduced a structured, high-stakes competition
        format that turned the game into a chaotic, cutthroat kill race.
      </p>
      <p>
        To kick off the event in style, I oversaw production of our announcement
        trailer revealing the event with swashbuckling energy, and a broadcast
        opener designed to immerse viewers in the competition’s high-stakes
        atmosphere as the event went underway.

    <h2>Bringing Competitive Spirit to the Holiday Season</h2>

    <p>
      For the Holiday Clash tournament, we took the Bilge Rat Bingo format and
      reworked it into a winter-themed competition, keeping the high-energy
      pacing while adding holiday-inspired challenges. The Holiday Clash
      introduced seasonal, thematic challenges as players raced to steal
      treasure, sink rival ships, and complete in-game holiday-themed
      objectives.
    </p>
    <p>
      With 1,400 average concurrent viewers and 200K social impressions, Holiday
      Clash reinforced Sea of Thieves as a community-driven competitive sandbox,
      proving the tournament format’s long-term potential.
