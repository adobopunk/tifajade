      As executive producer and director on this sports documentary series, I
      oversaw all aspects of production, from conception to final edit.

    <p>
      Fear None is a six-episode documentary series following the Richland High
      School football team as they go from #1 prospects to state champions.
      Through careful planning and coordination with the team, I was able to
      gain unprescedented access to the team, delivering special insight into
      their championship run through fly-on-the-wall videography, mics on
      players, and personal interviews with students and coaches. After
      traveling with the team and shooting hundreds of hours of footage, I spent
      two months editing it down into six one-hour long episodes, which aired on
      sports network SWX in 2017 and 2018.
