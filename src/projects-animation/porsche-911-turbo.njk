<p class="big">
  A high-stakes tournament redefining brand partnerships in esports.
</p>
<div class="side-by-side">
  <p>
    To celebrate the Porsche 911 Turbo’s arrival in Rocket League, Porsche and
    Psyonix partnered with BoomTV to create a first-of-its-kind tournament—one
    that would blend Porsche’s legacy of precision and speed with the
    electrifying, fast-paced world of Rocket League esports.
  </p>
  <p>
    It was a thrill to oversee production on a trailer and develop the motion
    strategy for this groundbreaking event, with the goal of capturing a
    seamless fusion of luxury automotive branding and high-energy esports
    storytelling.

  <h2>The Challenge:</h2>
  <div class="side-by-side">
    <p>
      1. Balancing Prestige & Esports Energy – The event needed to feel premium
      enough for Porsche while still high-adrenaline enough for Rocket League
      fans.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Building a Unified, Multi-Platform Brand Identity – Broadcast, social
      media, and in-game elements had to feel cohesive across all touchpoints.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Driving Engagement at Scale – The event needed to capture the Rocket
      League community, maximize Twitch viewership, and generate organic hype.

  <h2>The Solution:</h2>
  <div class="side-by-side">
    <div>
      <p class="big">Precision Meets Power</p>
      <p>
        We developed a high-energy, cinematic motion system that blended
        Porsche’s sleek, premium aesthetic with Rocket League’s explosive,
        high-speed gameplay. Every visual from trailers to scoreboards
        reinforced the fusion of esports and luxury.

      <p class="big">A Broadcast Engine Built for Speed</p>
      <p>
        A fully API-driven overlay system delivered real-time tournament data
        and live stats, ensuring that the broadcast felt dynamic, polished, and
        deeply integrated into the gameplay.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p class="big">The Trailer That Set the Stage</p>
      <p>
        To generate hype, we created a cinematic Porsche 911 Turbo tournament
        trailer that set the stakes for the competition. This teaser became a
        key asset for event marketing, influencer promotion, and pre-broadcast
        excitement.
