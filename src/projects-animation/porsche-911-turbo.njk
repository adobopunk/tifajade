  An iconic car. An iconic Esports title. And $50,000 on the line.

    When Porsche and Rocket League teamed up to bring the Porsche 911 to the
    game, they needed a creative, high-impact event that reflected Porsche’s
    prestige and Rocket League’s fast-paced esports environment. Enter the
    Porsche 911 Turbo Intivational.
  </p>
  <p>
    As Animation Director, I led visual direction and motion design strategy for
    this groundbreaking tournament, working closely with both brands to
    integrate them seamlessly into a compelling broadcast and online experience.

      <p class="big">Underdog Mentality</p>
      <p>
        To capture the classic storyline of the underdog rising to the top, we
        introduced an alternate PG icon inspired by street art culture. This
        subtle evolution appeals to the tournament’s grassroots community while
        reinforcing its competitive, high-energy atmosphere.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p class="big">Massive Viewership</p>
      <p>
        The tournament dominated Twitch viewership, with 14 out of 15 of the top
        Rocket League streams dedicated to the event, positioning it as a major
        success for both Porsche and Rocket League, and cementing the event as a
        new benchmark for esports partnerships.
