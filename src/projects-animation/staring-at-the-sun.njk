    <p class="big">A music project with visuals front-and-center.</p>
    <p>
      For their debut album, I've been working with rock band Staring at the Sun
      to create a series of visuals that capture the sound and themes of their
      music. For the first single off their upcoming album, Sungazer, I created
      animated album artwork and a set of motion graphics displaying cryptic
      messages, as we work to build lore around the band's music as part of an
      ongoing multimedia project.
    </p>

    <p>
      The visuals for Sungazer are only the first small step of this project,
      and I plan to update this page as we continue to release more artwork
      together. For now, check out the band's debut single

  Sungazer's single artwork is a 3D rendering made entirely in Blender. It was
  fun to explore different ways I could frame the visuals after creating the 3D
  scene. We iterated on different motion designs for a Spotify canvas, including
  an animated version of the single artwork. Ultimately we went with a direction
  that emphasized the lore and worldbuilding we're developing for the project.
