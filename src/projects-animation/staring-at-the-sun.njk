<h2>The Challenge</h2>

<div class="side-by-side">
  <p class="big">{{ subtitle }}</p>
  <p>
    Staring at the Sun wanted a visual identity that extended beyond traditional
    album artwork—something that could evolve alongside their music, build an
    interactive narrative, and engage audiences across streaming platforms and
    social media. My role was to develop a cohesive 3D animated aesthetic that
    translated seamlessly across Spotify Canvas loops, animated music videos,
    and cryptic promotional content that would tease future releases.

  <p class="big">Crafting a Cinematic Visual Identity</p>
  <p>
    Sungazer's single artwork is a 3D rendering made entirely in Blender. We
    iterated on different motion designs for a Spotify canvas, including an
    animated version of the artwork. Our chosen direction emphasized the lore
    and worldbuilding we're developing for the project.

  <p class="big">Designed for Multi-Platform Engagement</p>
  <p>
    I produced looping Spotify Canvas animations, teaser trailers, and
    short-form promotional assets, ensuring a unified aesthetic across music
    streaming platforms, social media, and YouTube.

  <p class="big">Expanding the Narrative Through Hidden Details</p>

    The visuals were designed to tease cryptic messages and hidden lore
    elements, making the project more than just an album—it became an
    interactive storytelling experience.

  The visuals for Sungazer are only the first small step of this project, and I
  plan to update this page as we continue to release more artwork together. For
