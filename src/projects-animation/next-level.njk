        When BoomTV producers heard the story of Riley "zSmit" Smith, we knew we
        had to share his story with the world.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      As the producer for Next Level, I led a team of passionate storytellers to
      bring to life the journey of skilled Call of Duty: Warzone player "zSmit,"
      whose rise from humble beginnings to top-earning talent carried a deeper
      emotional weight.

  From coordinating the logistics of remote production to shaping the doc’s
  narrative structure and guiding interview subjects, I ensured the story was
  compelling, authentic, and engaging for BoomTV’s audience of gamers and fans.
  My focus was on creating a piece that highlights Riley’s trajectory from
  unknown talent to top-earner, while resonating with fans by showcasing the
  personal growth and challenges of a modern esports competitor.

<p>
  I worked closely with Riley and his family to source archive images, map out
  his day-to-day life, and conduct introspective pre-interviews that helped
  inform the project and its emotional tone. Directing the film remotely, I
  oversaw on-location shoots and interviews timed with a major esports
  tournament. The result: an immersive, honest portrait of a modern competitor
  under pressure, told through the lens of the challenges that shaped him.
