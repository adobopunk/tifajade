      Bringing a new edge to the Proving Grounds brand for 2025.
    </p>
    <p>
      Proving Grounds is BoomTV's long-running pro-am esports series: an arena
      where aspiring esports competitors can compete for recognition and prizes.
      In 2025, Proving Grounds added Marvel Rivals events, while continuing to
      produce quality Apex Legends and Fortnite community tournaments. To get
      players excited about a new year of Proving Grounds, we refreshed the
      brand identity with an updated design and motion system.

      Moving into 2025, Proving Grounds leaves the status quo behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      To maintain the longstanding Proving Grounds branding, we kept the
      original logo and colors intact, while introducing an alternate, street
      art-inspired PG icon that evokes the tournament's underdog nature,
      appealing to aspiring esports athletes.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>
      The updated design system emphasizes movement and modularity. A single
      background loop, featuring a shifting Proving Grounds logo in monochrome,
      ties the package together and keeps production value high without
      distracting.
    </p>
    <p>
      A new addition to the Proving Grounds design is floating glass elements,
      which are rendered in 3D and distort items behind them. They're used to
      bring a new touch to the brand that feels organic and futuristic, evoking
      a bit of 2000-era futuristic glass. Evergreen assets like the broadcast
      intermission screen feature animated, pre-rendered versions of these glass
      elements spinning in place.

      Whether on Twitch or your social timeline, Proving Grounds stands out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Optimized for social media, a square version of the Proving Grounds 2025
      motion background allows designers to quickly create social media
      announcements that integrate seamlessly with other #PG 2025 visuals, while
      looking great on the timeline. The design's use of space allows a
      character render or influencer picture to live front and center.
    </p>
    <p>
      The package is built with the orange accent of Proving Grounds in mind,
      allowing important elements to easily stand out against the monochrome
      design simply by highlighting them with the iconic color.
