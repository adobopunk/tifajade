<p class="big">
  Moving into 2025, Proving Grounds leaves the status quo behind.
</p>

<div class="side-by-side">
  <p>
    Proving Grounds is BoomTV’s long-running pro-am esports series, providing a
    competitive space for aspiring esports athletes to gain recognition and
    compete for major prizes. The series expanded in 2025, introducing Marvel
    Rivals alongside existing Apex Legends and Fortnite events. It became clear
    that the brand identity needed an evolution to reflect its growing scope
    while maintaining its underdog, grassroots appeal.
  </p>
  <p>
    My role was to lead the creative vision for this refresh, ensuring that the
    new identity remained authentic to the Proving Grounds legacy while adapting
    the brand to use a scalable, animated design system fully adaptable across
    broadcast, social, and live events.

  <h2>The Challenge:</h2>
  <div class="side-by-side">
    <p>
      1. Retain the core Proving Grounds branding, colors, and logo while
      introducing a new design language that feels fresh, modular, and
      future-proof.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Establish a cohesive motion system that elevates the broadcast
      experience and keeps production flexible across Twitch, YouTube, and
      social media.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Ensure that the brand is instantly recognizable on social media, live
      streams, and tournament overlays—driving stronger engagement across
      platforms.

  <h2>The Solution:</h2>
  <p class="big">
    A Modular, High-Impact Identity where Street Art meets Esports.
  </p>
  <div class="side-by-side">
    <div>
      <p class="big">Underdog Mentality</p>
      <p>
        To capture the classic storyline of the underdog rising to the top, we
        introduced an alternate PG icon inspired by street art culture. This
        subtle evolution appeals to the tournament’s grassroots community while
        reinforcing its competitive, high-energy atmosphere.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p class="big">Past Meets Future</p>
      <p>
        Inspired by early 2000s futuristic design, floating glass distortions
        add a tactile, high-end feel while remaining evergreen assets that stand
        out to fans across both live broadcasts and social media campaigns.

      Whether on Twitch or your social timeline, Proving Grounds stands out.

      A dedicated square-format motion background for social media posts ensures
      that Proving Grounds content stays consistent and high-visibility across
      platforms. A subject-first design format allows for easy integration of
      player photos and influencer promotions.

      A shifting monochrome logo loop keeps visuals dynamic without overpowering
      tournament broadcasts. This system ensures that branding remains strong
      and cohesive without distracting from gameplay.
