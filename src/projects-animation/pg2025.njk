<h2>The Challenge</h2>

  </div>
  <p>
    As a long-running pro-am esports series, Proving Grounds needed a brand
    refresh that felt modern while still honoring its roots. The challenge was
    to create a modular design system that could scale across broadcast
    graphics, social media, and live tournament branding, ensuring that Proving
    Grounds stood out in an increasingly crowded competitive space. It was
    critical to maintain the underdog spirit that made the tournament unique
    while giving it a sleek, updated aesthetic.

  <h2>The Solution</h2>

  <div class="side-by-side">
    <p class="big">Street Art Meets Esports.</p>
    <p>
      To emphasize the underdog mentality, we leaned into street art culture,
      going so far as to introduce an alternate PG icon with a graffiti-inspired
      edge, reinforcing the tournamentâ€™s grassroots origins while giving it a
      modern impact.

  <div class="side-by-side">
    <p class="big">A High-Impact Motion System Built for Scale</p>
    <p>
      Inspired by early 2000s futuristic design, we balanced legacy branding
      with a futuristic, high-end motion system influenced by early 2000s design
      aesthetics.
