<h2>Design</h2>
<div class="side-by-side">
  <p class="big">
    Building on the original branding and logo, I worked with designer Mateo
    Julia-Wise on this refresh, leaning deeply on streaks of color, a modern
    tech core, and bold, frenetic animations.

    <h2>Animation</h2>

    <p>
      Combining noise and grain, mixed frame rates, and flashing patterns, I
      attempted to amplify the unapologetically intense style that captures the
      tournament's spirit. I directed a video promo to unveil the new refresh,
      signaling the tournament’s return for excited players.

<h2>Motion System</h2>

<div class="side-by-side">
  <p class="big">
    A versatile motion system creates a cohesive and instantly recognizable
    style for Proving Grounds social media and broadcasts alike.
  </p>
  <p>
    For live broadcasts, social media assets, website elements, and anything
    in-between, my goal was to make the new Proving Grounds animations instantly
    recognizable no matter the screen size or platform.
