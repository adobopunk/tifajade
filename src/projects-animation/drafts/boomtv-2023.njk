      <p class="big">A peek inside the creative sketchbook.</p>

      <p>
        To wrap up a year of great events, I directed an animation highlighting
        the BoomTV team's accomplishments during the 2023 year. This year's
        animation took on a 2D notebook format, bringing the creative process to
        the forefront while presenting Boom's statistics in an engaging way.
      </p>
      <p>
        BoomTV's leadership and stakeholders loved the concept, and the piece
        made its deubt on BoomTV socials as the year came to a close.
