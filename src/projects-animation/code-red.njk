      <p class="big">A Tournament Brand Engineered for Maximum Impact
      </p>
      <p>
        From the start, Code Red was designed to be bigger, bolder, and more influential than a single tournament. The goal was to create a recognizable esports franchise—one that could flex across different games, sponsors, and influencer-driven formats while always delivering high-energy, high-stakes competition.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p class="big">Blending Entertainment, Competition, and Brand Strategy</p>
      <p>
        Code Red’s success isn’t just about big names and big prizes—it’s about creating unforgettable content. Every tournament is built from the ground up to be a spectacle, incorporating cinematic trailers, motion-driven branding, and influencer-focused activations that generate excitement before the first match even begins.

      <p class="big">    A Scalable, Adaptable Identity
      </p>
      <p>
        Rather than following a rigid visual system, Code Red thrives on custom branding tailored to each event. Whether it’s the neon-soaked energy of Fortnite, the tactical precision of Counter-Strike, or the chaotic fun of Fall Guys, the branding remains distinct while still feeling unmistakably Code Red.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p class="big">A Platform for Sponsorship & Publisher Integration</p>
      <p>
        With presenting partners like Verizon, Hi-Chew, and the Army National Guard, Code Red serves as a powerful marketing vehicle for brands looking to engage gaming audiences. Each activation is seamlessly woven into the event’s broadcast package, motion system, and tournament structure, ensuring organic brand visibility without disrupting the competition.

    <p class="big">The Challenge</p>
    <p>
      Verizon’s goal was to engage the Fortnite community at scale while reinforcing its All-Access gaming initiative. The challenge was to create two back-to-back seasonal tournaments that felt unique yet maintained a cohesive brand presence.
    </p>
  </div>
<div>
  <p class="big">Creative Approach</p>
  <p>
    My team developed a pair of high-energy social announcement campaigns, leaning into seasonal themes and Fortnite’s dynamic in-game elements. These campaigns set the stage for Verizon’s Summer & Winter Fortnite series, helping drive engagement before the competition even started.
  </p>
</div>
<div>
  <p class="big">The Impact</p>
  <p>The campaign generated 2.3M+ total views across social media, proving the power of tailored, game-specific tournament branding.</p>

</div>

<div>
<div class="side-by-side">
  <div>
    <p class="big">The Challenge</p>
    <p>Verizon’s All-Access campaign needed a Halo-themed tournament that stood out in a crowded esports calendar. The challenge was to create a unique competitive experience that blended traditional esports gameplay with custom, highly shareable game modes.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p class="big">Creative Approach</p>
    <p>We designed a winter-themed Code Red Halo event, featuring a mix of standard competitive play and custom-built challenges. One of the highlights was Warthog Sumo, a custom game mode my team developed using Halo Infinite’s Forge tool, designed to add a fun, social element to the competition.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p class="big">The Impact</p>
    <p>The event drove 500K+ social impressions for Verizon and resulted in a massive content wave from participating influencers, including DrLupo, LEGIQN, Kurt Benkert, and Gigz. By creating a tournament that felt both competitive and entertaining, we delivered a format that engaged both hardcore Halo fans and casual audiences alike.</p>

<h2>Fall Guys – Bringing Party Game Chaos to Competitive Esports</h2>

<div class="side-by-side">
  <div>
    <p class="big">The Challenge</p>
    <p>Fall Guys was surging in popularity, but it wasn’t seen as a true competitive title. The goal was to create a high-energy tournament that captured the game’s chaotic fun while maintaining an esports-style event structure.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p class="big">Creative Approach</p>
    <p>We built a fully custom broadcast motion package, leaning into Fall Guys’ bright, playful aesthetic while adding esports-style branding to make the event feel high-stakes. The tournament attracted 75 top-tier players, creating an unexpected collision of party game randomness and elite gaming talent.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p class="big">The Impact</p>
  <p>The event pulled in 40,000 concurrent viewers and generated 750K+ social impressions, proving that even a casual-focused game could thrive in a competitive format.</p>

      <div>
        <p class="big">The Challenge</p>
        <p>
          Hi-Chew wanted to use Code Red as a platform to reach gaming audiences, but unlike Verizon, it wasn’t a brand traditionally associated with esports. The challenge was creating a natural, engaging way to introduce Hi-Chew into the Fortnite scene.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p class="big">Creative Approach</p>
        <p>We designed a tournament around Legiqn, a well-loved gaming personality, positioning him as the face of the event. This ensured the branding felt organic while giving Hi-Chew a built-in community connection. Additionally, we produced a series of branded content pieces, extending the event’s presence beyond just the tournament day.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p class="big">The Impact</p>
        <p>Hi-Chew was so impressed with the campaign’s performance that they invited Legiqn to become a brand ambassador, turning a one-time sponsorship into an ongoing partnership.</p>

    <p>The Army National Guard wanted to use Code Red as a launchpad for its own branded tournament series. The challenge was integrating military branding into an Apex Legends tournament in a way that felt natural, immersive, and engaging for players.</p>

  </div>
  <div>
    <p class="big">Creative Approach</p>
    <p>We developed a new brand-within-a-brand: Code Freedom. Our cinematic trailer for the event visually placed Code Freedom inside the world of Apex Legends, using motion tracking and environment compositing.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p class="big">The Impact</p>
    <p>Code Freedom became an established sub-brand within Code Red, giving the Army National Guard a sustainable entry point into esports marketing, and leading them to extend their partnership with us through another two years. </p>
