    <p class="big">The Challenge</p>
    <p>Verizonâ€™s All-Access campaign needed a tournament that stood out in a crowded esports calendar. The challenge was to create a unique competitive experience that blended traditional esports gameplay with custom, highly shareable game modes.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p class="big">The Solution</p>
    <p>We designed a winter-themed, Code Red branded Halo event, featuring a mix of standard competitive play and custom-built challenges. One of the highlights was Warthog Sumo, a custom game mode we developed, bringing a fun, social element to the competition.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p class="big">The Impact</p>
    <p>The event drove 500K+ social impressions for Verizon and resulted in a massive content wave from participating influencers, including DrLupo, LEGIQN, Kurt Benkert, and Gigz.</p>

    <p class="big">The Challenge</p>
    <p>Fall Guys was surging in popularity, but it wasnâ€™t seen as a true competitive title. The goal was to create a high-energy tournament that captured the gameâ€™s chaotic fun, while maintaining an esports-style event structure.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p class="big">The Solution</p>
    <p>We built a fully custom broadcast package, leaning into Fall Guysâ€™ bright, playful aesthetic. The tournament attracted 75 top-tier players, creating an unexpected collision of party game randomness and elite gaming talent.</p>

  <div>
    <p class="big">The Impact</p>
  <p>The event pulled in 40,000 concurrent viewers and generated 750K+ social impressions, proving that even a casual-focused game could thrive in a competitive format, and paving the way for massive partnerships, like...</p>

        <p>
          Hi-Chew wanted to use Code Red as a platform to reach gaming audiences, but unlike Verizon, it wasnâ€™t a brand traditionally associated with esports. The challenge was creating a natural, engaging way to introduce Hi-Chew into the Fortnite scene.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p class="big">The Solution</p>
        <p>We designed a tournament in collaboration with LEGIQN, a well-loved gaming personality, positioning him as the face of the event. This ensured the branding felt organic while giving Hi-Chew a built-in community connection. </p>

      <div>
        <p class="big">The Impact</p>
        <p>Hi-Chew was so impressed with the campaignâ€™s performance that they invited LEGIQN to become a brand ambassador, turning a one-time sponsorship into an ongoing partnership.</p>
