      <p class="big">Empowering the Next Generation of Esports Talent</p>
      <p>
        A national esports initiative. A high-stakes LAN championship. A
        platform for rising talent.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      Intel Inspires is one of the largest scholastic esports events in the
      industry, bringing together 10,000+ students from nearly 500 schools for a
      three-day summit and LAN championship. The event provides rising high
      school and college esports athletes with the opportunity to compete, learn
      from industry leaders, and connect with recruiters.

  <h2>The Challenge:</h2>
  <div class="side-by-side">
    <p>
      1. Intel Inspires is an eight-month scholastic tournament series
      culminating in a live championship and industry summit. The challenge was
      to develop a cohesive visual identity that matched the scale and
      significance of the event.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The event featured 18 speaking sessions, 11 hours of content, and 223
      educators in attendance. To maximize engagement, we needed to ensure
      dynamic, promo-ready video coverage that highlighted both the competition
      and the professional development opportunities.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Beyond viewership, the event was designed to shift brand sentiment and
      lead generation for Intel and its partners (ASUS, CDW, SHI, and
      Connection). The challenge was ensuring the event’s content and branding
      reinforced Intel’s leadership in gaming and esports.
