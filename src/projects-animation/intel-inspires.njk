  <h2>The Challenge</h2>
  <p>
    Intel Inspires is one of the largest scholastic esports events. With an
    eight-month tournament series culminating in a live championship, it needed
    a cohesive identity that matched its scale. Beyond competition, the event
    had to drive brand engagement, career development, and lead generation for
    Intel and partners.

<h2>The Solution</h2>

<div class="side-by-side">
  <p class="big">A Unified Identity for Scholastic Esports</p>
  <p>
    From social promos to event signage, we adapted Intelâ€™s corporate branding
    into a true esports identity, modular enough to integrate partner brands
    like ASUS, CDW, and SHI while maintaining a unified and modern design system
    for screens of all sizes.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="side-by-side">
  <p class="big">A Pathway to Success</p>
  <p>
    We built Intel Inspires to be a structured pathway for high school and
    college players to compete, network, and gain visibility from the start. The
    summit was designed to not only showcase top talent but also to educate and
    connect students with industry professionals and recruiters.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="side-by-side">
  <p class="big">Competition & Career Development</p>
  <p>
    With a three-day LAN championship and industry summit, we delivered a dual
    experienceâ€”high-energy esports alongside thought leadership panels and
    networking sessions, so players and educators could leave with meaningful
    insights and career opportunities.
