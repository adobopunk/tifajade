  <h2>The Challenge</h2>

  <p>
    Fortnite OG was an emotional, exciting moment for the entire Fortnite
    community. In a first-of-its-kind content event, fans returned to the
    original map that was removed from the game back in 2017. To promote this
    legacy event and celebrate with fans and influencers alike, Epic Games
    needed a canâ€™t-miss tournament that felt like a true homecoming for the
    community.

<h2>The Solution</h2>

<div class="side-by-side">
  <p class="big">Class of 2017?</p>
  <p>
    Among the concepts presented, the clear winner was "The Reunion," drawing
    connections to class reunions and seeing old friends from the past. The
    title was perfect for Epic, and I built off this concept to conceptualize a
    winning trailer style that would draw millions of views.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="side-by-side">
  <p class="big">A Delicious Trailer With a Side of Nostalgia</p>
  <p>
    To make The Reunion felt like a celebration, I pitched the Fortnite team on
    a massive cake shaped like the returning map. Loving the concept, they
    worked closely with me to coordinate which iconic locations would be
    returning, and together we unveiled The Reunion to fans in delicious style.

  <p class="big">Extending The Style</p>
  <p>
    With the trailer conceptualized and production underway, I next worked on
    extending that same bright, colorful style to the rest of the event design.
    We iterated through variations on the logo, working closely with the
    Fortnite team as their branding and style evolved alongside ours.
