<h2>The Challenge</h2>

<div class="side-by-side">
  <p class="big">{{ subtitle }}</p>
  <p>
    In Queue was founded by esports veterans who grew tired of seeing
    competition take a backseat to commercial interests. As a founding member, I
    led creative direction for our launch, with the goal of rallying the esports
    community around a bold new player‚Äîdefined by veteran talent, a clear value
    system, and a focus on elevating the culture of competitive gaming.

</div>

<h2>The Solution</h2>
<div class="side-by-side">
  <p class="big">A Logo Built on Four Key Pillars</p>
  <p>
    We explored a wide range of directions before landing on a logo that felt
    iconic, ownable, and natural to animate. The final mark features four
    outward-facing arrows, symbolizing our core values: Integrity, Community,
    Opportunity, and Excellence. Its emblem-style silhouette fits naturally into
    the esports space while echoing the feeling of a game queue‚Äîa subtle nod
    built into the brand‚Äôs DNA.

  <p class="big">A Reveal Video That Tells Our Story</p>
  <p>
    To launch In Queue with impact, I directed a cinematic brand reveal that
    brought our mission and values to the forefront. The animation slowly builds
    anticipation as the logo assembles piece by piece, accompanied by bold
    animated typography and a pulsing sci-fi score. Using Blender‚Äôs Eevee
    renderer and After Effects, I created the piece in just a few days‚Äîtying in
    cheeky audio samples that reinforce our commitment to fair play.

  <p class="big">A Launch Site Built for the Moment</p>
  <p>
    I designed and developed
    <a href="https://playinqueue.com" target="_blank">our launch website</a> in
    less than a week. Built to be clean, fast, and mobile-friendly, the site
    centered our reveal video visuals while giving context to the brand‚Äôs
    founding principles. Every design decision aimed to balance polish with
    clarity‚Äîdelivering just enough without overexplaining.

  <p class="big">A Focused Social Rollout</p>
  <p>
    Our brand reveal was supported by a week-long rollout across Twitter,
    Instagram, and Discord. I helped deliver the messaging across all platforms,
    adapting visuals and messaging to suit each channel. The launch sparked
    immediate engagement from fans, players, and industry peers‚Äîvalidating the
    demand for a values-driven approach to esports.
