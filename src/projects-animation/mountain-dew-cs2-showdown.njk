      A high concept announcement trailer for Mountain Dew's Counter-Strike
      showmatch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mountain Dew asked for something high energy and brand centric to announce
      their big influencer showdown. To kick off the event, I crafted a Mountain
      Dew Code Red themed PC, using Mountain Dew's winner trophy as the
      skeleton, kitbashing PC parts, and modeling a CS-style bomb to detonate at
      the end of the virtual PC flythrough, revealing the game title and event
      details.

    The team at Mountain Dew Gaming was hyped about the video, and fans on
    social media loved the concept. As a computer nerd and DIY PC builder, I
    will disclose that there is nothing functional about this PC, as I modeled
    it strictly to look cool, not be accurate. There are multiple motherboards,
    graphics cards, hard drives, and other junk in there that simply wouldn't
    make a functional PC in the real world, but it's nice to look at!

    To end the video and transition to the event's title card, I referenced
    Counter-Strike's iconic C4 bomb, modeling my own rendition with an explosive
    transition.
