<h2>Concept</h2>

<div class="side-by-side">
  <p class="big">
    A bold set of 3D visuals centered around a fantasy-inspired glowing pond
    evokes creativity and growth.
  </p>
  <p>
    Rooted in the studio’s organic origins, Tiny Pond’s branding revolves around
    a glowing pond. Using Blender, I crafted a vibrant 3D environment teeming
    with life — dancing fireflies, animated ripples, and lush, swaying foliage —
    capturing the studio’s essence in motion. For the website, I seamlessly
    integrated designs by Mateo Julia-Wise into this environment, showcasing the
    studio's graphical offerings within our unique branded landscape.

<h2 class="project__step-title">Web Design</h2>

<div class="side-by-side">
  <p class="big">
    Deep blues, vibrant greens, and a touch of pink bring together a color
    scheme that feels connected with nature.
  </p>
  <p>
    A design-first website showcases the studio's animation capabilities with
    videos showcased on arrival, while the responsive services section outlines
    a diversity of offerings, making it easy for clients to understand the
    studio's offerings alongside the expansive portfolio section. My goal was to
    build a seamless experience that invites exploration and encourages
    potential clients to engage with Tiny Pond's portfolio and offerings.
