      Producing a once-in-a-lifetime fan experience with the developers of
      Deadrop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deadrop was a game being developed by Midnight Society, a studio of
      ex-Call of Duty, Halo, and Fortnite developers. In its early access
      period, Deadrop held a few "Snapshot" events for fans, who were invited to
      attend an in-person convention style event to see new features revealed,
      and be the first to test-drive a new game build.
    </p>
    <p>
      Midnight Society ultimately closed its doors in 2025, leaving the game
      unfinished. It was a pleasure to meet some of its talented developers
      during my brief collaboration with the studio to bring this snapshot event
      to life.

<div class="side-by-side">
  <div>
    <p>
      As a remote studio, Midnight Society's developers aren't often in the same
      room. That's why for their big snapshot event for fans, it was essential
      to be on location with the developers in a rare meetup, to sit down with
      them on-camera, hear them explain the features of their game, and edit
      their interviews into features for the big night. Day 1 consisted of
      sit-downs and editing the raw interviews. On Day 2, I designed motion
      graphics and worked with the developers to capture in-game footage.
    </p>
    <p>
      In just a few days, I was able to execute a full video package, along with
      motion design, social assets to promote the live broadcast, and graphics
      for the arena. The event, with presenting sponsor Cheez-It, was a huge
      success, with thousands of fans filling the arena to see new features
      unveiled, watch influencers compete on the big stage, and get their hands
      on the game at demo stations.

<h2 class="project__step-title">Broadcast and Arena Design</h2>
<div class="side-by-side">
  <p>
    While on-site at the arena, I built a dynamic motion design system for the
    event's video features, broadcast loops, stingers, and arena billboards.
    With access to developer builds, I captured in-game environments, composited
    seamless loops, and in collaboration with designer Mateo Julia-Wise, we
    rendered extra-wide motion graphics for the massive triple screens at
    Esports Arena, and the various digital billboards throughout the stadium.
  </p>
  <p>
    With the event video and design locked and shipped off to the control room,
    all that was left for me to do was attend the event as a videographer,
    capturing on-the-fly interviews and a wealth of footage for the dev team to
    use on further promotion of the title.
