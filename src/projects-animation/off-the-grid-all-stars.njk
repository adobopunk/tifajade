      A futuristic battle royale. A star-studded tournament. A high-stakes
      introduction to competitive play.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gunzilla Games’ Off The Grid entered the competitive gaming scene with a
      $600,000 All Stars tournament, featuring some of the biggest names in
      streaming and battle royale esports. To help solidify Off The Grid as a
      serious contender in the space, my team developed a high-end motion system
      and animation style that anchored the live broadcast and tournament
      branding.

  <h2>The Challenge:</h2>
  <div class="side-by-side">
    <p>
      1. With Off The Grid still in its early access phase, the tournament
      wasn’t just a competition—it was an introduction. The challenge was
      crafting a premium esports aesthetic that gave the game an instant
      presence in the competitive gaming landscape.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The $600K prize pool put Off The Grid on the same level as major
      esports titles, and the visual presentation had to match. The challenge
      was creating a motion package that felt high-stakes and visually distinct
      from other battle royales.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Reach as many viewers as possible while positioning Off The Grid as a
      premium esports title with high production value. Graphics and motion
      design had to be seamless, engaging, and optimized for multi-platform
      viewing.

  <h2>The Solution:</h2>

  <div class="side-by-side">
    <div>
      <p class="big">A Gold-Infused Motion System for a Prestige Tournament</p>
      <p>
        We developed a sleek, gold-accented motion package that reinforced Off
        The Grid's futuristic aesthetic while elevating the tournament’s
        prestige. From dynamic lower thirds to high-energy stingers and animated
        overlays, every element reflected the high stakes and competitive
        intensity of the event.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p class="big">A Streamlined Broadcast Experience</p>
      <p>
        The motion system was designed to integrate seamlessly across both the
        official tournament stream and player-led broadcasts, ensuring a
        consistent and professional visual experience no matter where the event
        was viewed.
