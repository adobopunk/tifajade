    Gunzilla Gamesâ€™ Off The Grid was still in early access, but its developers
    wanted to launch the game into the competitive scene with a $600K All-Stars
    tournament. The tournament needed to do more than just introduce players to
    Off The Gridâ€”it had to position the game as a serious contender in esports
    while maximizing visibility through Twitch, influencer streams, and social
    media.
