    <p class="big">
      In 2018, Impact Gaming housed its H1Z1 Pro League team in Las Vegas,
      Nevada for a 10 week competition against the best of the best.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I joined Impact as their creative producer, the staff was me, the
      team manager, and the company's CEO. A small team, to say the least!
      Impact signed a H1Z1 Pro League team, and I developed a content offering
      that lifted Impact from a no-name esports org to one with a sizable
      fanbase, invested in the stories of the players I told through hundreds of
      hours of filmed footage, personal interviews, and deliberate, structured
      storytelling that highlighted their successes and failures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Developing the company's entire content strategy, while balancing my
      duties with managing partner activations, shooting and editing everything,
      and managing budgets and equipment - was all certainly hectic, but granted
      me valuable experience that helped me level up in my career. This is just
      a sample of the video work I developed while with Impact Gaming. Enjoy!
