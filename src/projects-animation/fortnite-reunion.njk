    <p>
      The Fortnite team threw a grand reunion bash for their Fortnite OG event,
      gathering legends old and new to duke it out on the beloved classic map.
      The goal was to design a celebratory event that would feel as nostalgic as
      a class reunion, with all the joy of a long-awaited homecoming.

<h2>Animation</h2>

<div class="side-by-side">
  <p>
    Working closely with the team at Epic to learn exactly which locations would
    return, I began modeling low-poly versions of the map's iconic locations.
    Coordination was key, as locations change over time, and I wasn't sure which
    version of the map would be coming back.
  </p>
  <p>
    But the Epic team was awesome to work with, and together we were able to
    present an accurate version of the map as it would appear on launch day. An
    extensively researched system of over 30,000 particles rounded out the look
    of the cake, with frosting drop trees and delicious sprinkles coating the
    surface in an edible terrain system.

<h2>Broadcast Design</h2>

<div class="side-by-side">
  <p class="big">An oh-so-sweet motion system for a fun, dynamic broadcast.</p>
  <p>
    With the cake as a centerpiece, the next step was to animate the playful 3D
    logo. We designed custom broadcast screens and elements that harmonized with
    the cake's aesthetic, integrating bold colors and lively graphics that
    realized a cohesive and immersive broadcast design.
