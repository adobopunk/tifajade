      Made entirely in Blender, I designed this 3D, 90's arcade-inspired world
      to celebrate an incredible year of achievements for BoomTV.

<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>
  I had a lot of fun doing design research and making
  <a href="https://pin.it/6ZDH85YdT" target="_blank"
    >mood and reference boards</a
  >
  inspired by the bold, eclectic aesthetic of the 90s and early Y2K era. I drew heavily from the vibrant neon color schemes and funky geometric patterns that defined the time. Overall, the animation attempts to embrace the quirky, playful energy that was everywhere in millennial aesthetics.

<h2>Grease Pencil</h2>
<p>
  Having primarily used Blender for realistic 3D animation, I wanted to try
  something new for this project and took a deep dive into stylized 3D,
  conducting in-depth research into the Grease Pencil tool. I learned a lot from
  <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=blender+grease+pencil"
    target="_blank"
    >community tutorials on YouTube</a
  > and the CG Boost course "Magic Storybook." Drawing on 3D planes
  was a learning curve, but once it clicked with my brain it became
  second nature.
  <p>For this project, I used the Apple Pencil and my iPad as a monitor via Astropad software (with their Luna HDMI hardware). Drawing directly in Blender was an incredibly enjoyable experience, so much so that Iâ€™ve since upgraded my setup to a Wacom screen tablet, eager to dive deeper into this style of work.</p>
