    <h2>Hi, I'm Tifa Jade, but you can call me TJ. Welcome to my portfolio!</h2>

    <div class="gallery__intro">
      <p>
        I'm a Pacific Northwest based video professional specializing in motion
        design and 3D animation, with a background in narrative and documentary
        filmmaking and video editing. Feel free to explore my portfolio! For
        samples of my video editing and production, see
        <a href="/video/index.html">this page.</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        I learned how to code so I could build this website from the ground up,
        and I'm frequently adding new projects and updates. You can see the
        updates to this website on
        <a href="https://github.com/adobopunk" target="_blank">my Github.</a>
        Thanks for stopping by!
