    copy: "I’m a Creative Director and Video Producer with a lot of ambition and a knack for visual storytelling. Typically behind the scenes and behind the camera, but like any good filmmaker you'll catch me staring down the barrel of a lens while framing a shot. I live in Seattle with my cat Rogue, where I build computers and enjoy cooking Mexican food. Here's how I got here.",

    copy: "I grew up in Richland, Washington, making backyard movies with friends. I loved action films like The Matrix and Mission: Impossible. I taught myself After Effects in 5th grade, entered student art competitions, and earned a spot in independent study programs to sharpen my filmmaking skills even before high school.",

    copy: "I studied film at Eastern Washington University, where four of my short films screened at the Spokane International Film Festival and they named me “Most Promising Filmmaker.” Most importantly, I learned how to tell meaningful stories, lead a great crew, and direct successful projects end-to-end. By the time I graduated, I had the skills to tell stories for a living.",

    copy: "My journey led me to become Creative Services Director for my hometown NBC affiliate, where the pay was awful but the experience was invaluable. I pitched, directed, edited, and designed campaigns while rapidly developing my motion graphics skills. I built strong partnerships with local business owners and directed the station’s first Spanish newscast for Telemundo — a milestone in community outreach for the area.",

    copy: "Eager to push beyond small-town markets, I pitched a docuseries about a rising high school football team to my boss, and convinced him to say yes. I filmed what became a championship season, edited down thousands of hours of footage, and delivered the entire project to air on TV as a solo director/producer, barely a year after graduating college.",

    copy: "Next I joined an esports startup called Impact Gaming, relocating to Las Vegas. I shaped their brand identity and content strategy, and even produced another docuseries. I wasn't an expert in esports—nor had I been an expert in football. But I knew how to build trust, capture honest stories, and craft emotional narratives that connect with audiences.",

I worked on long-form programming for Fight Pass and ESPN, and helped market record-breaking Pay-Per-View events. I thrived in one of the world’s fastest-paced, most intense production environments, sharpening my creative instincts and leadership abilities.",

Directing creative projects for a games marketing agency meant partnering with names like Fortnite, Halo, and Sea of Thieves, designing experiences that earned millions of impressions, and recognition from industry veterans.",
